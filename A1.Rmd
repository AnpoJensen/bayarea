## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/R")

ca_counties <- counties("CA", cb = T, progress_bar =F)
projection <- "+proj=utm +zone10 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=ft +no_defs"

st_crs(ca_counties)

ca_counties_transformed <- ca_counties %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  st_transform(26910) %>%
  st_transform(projection) %>%
  st_transform(st_crs(ca_counties))

Geospatial map

```{r}
res_pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "viridis",
  domain = 
    pge_1920_elec$CHANGE
)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = pge_1920_elec, 
    fillColor = ~res_pal(CHANGE),
    color = "white",
    fillOpacity = 0.5,
    weight = 1, 
    label = ~paste0(
      round(CHANGE),
      "kWh change in ",
      ZIPCODE
    ),
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2, 
      opacity = 1
    )
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    data = pge_1920_elec, 
    pal = res_pal, 
    values = ~CHANGE, 
    title = "Regional Change in kWh, comparing 2019 and 2020"
  )
```

Here we don't see that many changes or significant changes across the bay area. However, I thought it was interesting to see one county yellow describing significant change. Also Gilroy, is known for its farmers markets and thus also seeme to experience signficant change. 


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pge_final$DATE <- paste(pge_final$YEAR, "-", pge_final$MONTH,"-01", sep="") %>% as.Date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")


pge_chart <- 
  pge_final %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(
    aes(
      x = DATE, 
      y = TOTALKBTU,
      fill= CUSTOMERCLASS
    ),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack"
    
  ) +
  
  labs(
    x = "MONTH",
    y= "kBTU",
    title = "PG&E Bay Area Monthly kBTU Usage 17-2020",
    fill = "CUSTOMERCLASS"
  ) + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%m-%y", expand = c(0,0)) + 
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, angle = 45, color = "black",
      vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

pge_chart

```


In my analysis there were some limitations. It appears this only accounts for Q1+Q2. But as we look at the dates where the pandemic starts there was an increase in electric-residential and decrease in gas-residential. This could reflect that more and more residents were staying home rather than going into work. This trend also reflects the seasons in winter. We see an increase of use in the winters and decrease in the warmer seasons.
